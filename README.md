# Hey, Im Prach and I just do sum shi.

Mostly out of curiosity, boredom, or the occasional existential crisis. I code what feels good - no roadmap, no agile boards, no corporate nonsense. Just raw, chaotic creation.

## Honorable Mentions

- 🔗 [**prach-browse**](https://github.com/prasifka/prach-browse) 
  A browser that doesn't ask for permission. Bypass restrictions, tunnel through censorship, and pretend HTTP still rules the world.

- 🧵 [**prach-social**](https://github.com/prasifka/prachsocial)
  A complete social media web app. Because if you're going to build a platform that wastes people’s time, you might as well own the code.

## 📜 My (Lack of) Philosophy

I don’t believe in gatekeeping, walled gardens, or reinventing the same CRUD app in new frameworks.
I also don’t believe in societal structures, hierarchies, or pretending that code needs a business plan.

I don’t have a grand mission. I just make things. Sometimes they’re useful. Sometimes they’re dangerous. Sometimes they’re just funny.

Welcome to the fog of dust.
